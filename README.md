# Movie-Recommendation-System-ML_Project-
Movie recommendation is an engine that filters movies and suggests them to the user based on their past viewing experiences. This engine has gained more popularity due to the impact of various OTT platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstar, etc. We have used 3 different algorithms to make our model and execute the engine. First is K-Means clustering, which makes clusters of the movie based on Rating and popularity. Second is the KNN algorithm, which takes the Genre as input, and it displays the nearest neighbors pertaining to the same Genre. Lastly, we have used the SVM algorithm to train our model and give the list of the movies according to the Genre given as input. Based on the execution of the models according to the algorithms as mentioned above, we can concur that the KNN model is more suited than the SVM model to execute the recommendation system.
